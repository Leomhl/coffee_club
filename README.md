# Coffee club app

I developed this app for a coffee shop (2020). Unfortunatelly I can't share the code about contract issues. 
But, I want to share the UI and functionalities. It's an app for clients receive promotions and updates about new products. 
This app works using Firebase, FCM (push notifications), crashlytics, analytics, GetX, mocktail, lottie, carousel, clean code and architecture.


You can see the video how it works:
